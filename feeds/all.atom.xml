&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Redox OS Logo" src="https://wikiwandv2-19431.kxcdn.com/_next/image?url=https:%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2F5%2F57%2FRedox_logo_2015.svg%2F1500px-Redox_logo_2015.svg.png&amp;amp;w=3840&amp;amp;q=50"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought it would be cool if I covered the development of &lt;a href="https://redox-os.org/"&gt;Redox OS&lt;/a&gt;.  This OS is in early development, and is up and coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Another Operating System?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might ask yourself: Why do we need so many different operating systems?  That is a valid question, because operating systems are hard to get used to using, and complex to develop, so why  are there so many? The answer is simpler than we might think. I believe that answer is in the problem that operating system attempt to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An operating system in simple terms is a collection of software (rarely a single program) that runs on computer hardware. This software manages the computer's resources to accomplish the will of the user, the hard part comes when UI and security comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;UI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UI (User Interface) is what a user uses to physically interact with data displayed on the screen in a way that's pleasing to the eyes. A UI must be fast, intuitive, stable, and secure.  Because of this they can be difficult to develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Security&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Cybersecurity Image" src="https://www.biia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/iStock_000022579586Medium.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security in the context of operating systems usually refers to the way the operating system handles files, user input, network traffic, passwords, down to managing data stored in RAM while a program runs. Security is the most important aspect of an operating system, and is necessary for the developers of an operating system to get right before it is used in production. This is an ongoing process that usually spans the entire life of the OS. And we have only discussed operating systems in the context of individual users, that doesn't cover how they are used to run servers in what's called a "headless" configuration. In this mode the OS doesn't run a UI and only manages the computer resources to host a web site, cloud app, game, or some other software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So what problems do Redox OS attempt to solve?  And how?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redox OS is YAUOS (Yet Another Unix-like Operating System) but this one differs from Linux or FreeBSD by following a different paradigm. Redox is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkernel"&gt;microkernel&lt;/a&gt; operating system, it minimizes the amount of software that runs and communicates directly with the hardware. This provides better security than traditional kernels because software that would usually run at a lower level can run at a higher level, this makes it safer. Redox has a funny new thing up it's sleeve though, we'll talk about that next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Redos is written in Rust.  So what?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Rust Lang Image" src="https://sanet.pics/storage-6/1220/uGsov8AhfvJOSgSNlHmUMH57ZAdhVVuB.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redox is one of the first operating systems written in a language called &lt;a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/"&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt;. Rust is a special programming language that guarantees certain things while using it that other languages can't. Rust has what's called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_safety"&gt;memory safety&lt;/a&gt;. This protects the programmer from pitfalls of languages such as C and C++ that Linux and Windows are written in. This also improves security as a high percentage of vulnerabilites are the result of poor programming practices, and human error. So the idea is, if the programming language used to program the operating system is itself safe and secure, it will to a long way towards writing secure operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="RedoxOS"></category><category term="os"></category><category term="operating system"></category><category term="microkernel"></category><category term="redox"></category><category term="rust"></category></entry><entry><title>AI, Bio Computing, and it's Impacts</title><link href="https://codecanna.github.io/ai-biocomputing-and-its-impacts.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-11-03T19:13:00-07:00</published><updated>2024-11-03T19:13:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Mark A Waid</name></author><id>tag:codecanna.github.io,2024-11-03:/ai-biocomputing-and-its-impacts.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;What are the implications of AI and Bio Computing for our society?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Artificial Intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image Source: https://itchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/where-is-ai-used.jpg" src="https://itchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/where-is-ai-used.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you hear the term A.I., what comes to mind? Terminator? The computer from Space Odyssey?  Video game AI?  These are all small examples of artificial intelligence.  AI exists to solve many problems, but one major one is the problem of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_explosion"&gt;combinatorial explosion&lt;/a&gt;, where a problem's solution becomes more complex as the problem's complexity grows.  Some problems are complex but have simple answers, while other problems seem simple but require complex answers, while others have a solution that grows in complexity with the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In computing, this has the effect of developers writing more complex, error-prone code to solve these problems, which require a complex solution. A.I. can make decisions based on its own "experience" rather than relying on a developer to code for every possible contingency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bio Computing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="https://nextconf.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/star-trek-borg.jpg" src="https://nextconf.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/star-trek-borg.jpg"&gt;
Biocomputing is a real science fiction sounding thing, but make no mistake, it's very real and very cool!  Biocomputing is the study, research, and development of computer systems that run on biological constructs.  Using neurons to make a computation or DNA to store data.  These are examples of biocomputing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever heard of the Borg from Star Trek?  That's a great scifi example of biocomputing.  If you don't know, the Borg are a fictional race from the Star Trek universe who are augmented with computerized implants to take over certain bodily functions as well as connect them to the "Hive Mind."  We have computer implants right now that perform important biological functions for their users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loop Recorder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pace Maker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ocular Implant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reading an &lt;a href="https://fandomwire.com/after-a-calculator-powered-by-700-potatoes-gamers-manage-to-run-doom-on-rat-brain-cells/"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; this yesterday about researchers who were able to get DOOM to run on Neurons.  Another really cool example is researcher who used a species of slime mold to map out the most efficient route between cities in Japan.  And the slime mold possesses no brain.  Yet it can find the most efficient rout in a fraction of the time that Japan's engineers were able to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How it effects us all&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Everyday Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effects of this technology on everyday life is yet to be seen but, society has wasted little time integrating AI into every aspect of life, which has been as helpful as it has been divisive.  It has come with all sorts of implications from artists feeling threatened because of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence"&gt;generative AI&lt;/a&gt; to being paranoid that everything you see online is made by AI instead of someone putting in work.  YouTube videos, you might even wonder if this article was written by AI (it wasn't).  A.I. is another tool that we must be mature enough to use, or we will live in fear of it and it won't end well.    A.I. allows users to perform more work in less time, but I feel it also makes that work less rewarding.  If I generated this article than I wouldn't get as much out of it as I am sitting next to my wife writing it by hand.  On the other hand, medical research, security, among other things is where I feel that A.I. will shine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Moral Implications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked a little about the morals of A.I. above but here we will go more in depth.  One of the main issues with A.I. is who owns the content generative A.I. generates?  This content is being created by and A.I. trained using millions of images of art from different artists, it basically learns and replicates just like a human.  There is nothing new under the sun, we do things the same way just slower.  An artist looks at other artists work for inspiration, so in that case is the art produced from that artist original since its inspired by experience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are missing something important here, inspiration doesn't only come from experience gained from other's work; but from our experience in life and that's where the AI will fall short i think.  The depth of anything generated by A.I. will be limited because A.I. has no life experience to look to for inspiration.  They can only copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so this hasn't stopped many from being fearful of A.I. to the point of avoiding it entirely, while i myself am worried about the negative impact it will have on our own problem solving abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you made it this far thanks so much for reading!  Keep checking back here on my blog for new posts about technology, life, philosophy and more!

&lt;p&gt;Time, a human construct?  Or natural phenomenon. Whatever side you are on the effects of time on everything around us is very real.  We often sit and wonder why time is moving slow, or we wonder why it moves fast when we are having a good time when we actually want it to last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time unlike most possessions we have in our lives is irreplaceable, completely and totally irreplaceable.  Kind of like our loved ones, and the time we spend with them.  So that makes us wonder, how can it be that we have a system to sell our time for something as replaceable as money?  It seems twisted and unnatural.  We become part of this human made system where our time is controlled by some suit or group of suits.  To me this is unacceptable, this is backwards. I don't pretend to have the answers or another better magical system, I'm just calling out the one we got because I feel it necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a 30 year old autistic adult who has been through almost as many jobs as my age, however I've never been fired, most of these jobs I quit because of the way I was being treated, the others because I was made fun of for being slower.  All these years of these types of jobs and all the change that came with moving jobs so often has left me professionally empty and uncaring. I am against this employment system we have now because its been so awful to me.  If you reading this is an autistic adult, who have had similar experiences in the work place know that you are not alone!  You are a person just like anyone else who is employed where you are.  Don't take crap from co-workers and make sure you are comfortable at work.  Because your time is invaluable, its beyond value.  You can't truly put a price on it.  If anything is an awful human construct it's the concept of trading time for money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello!  Welcome to the first post of my blog.  This feels akin to writing in a diary, except it's meant to be shared.  My name is Mark, and I'm starting this blog to hold everything that my brain can't anymore.  I learn as I get older the more important realestate in my brain becomes.  Here I will write my two cents(beans) about different topics I find interesting or that I think should just be written about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the beginning of my journey into the world of blogging.  What am I looking to get out of it?  I ask myself this question as well, and I haven't quite answered that yet, maybe thats the whole point of this...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now there's not set upload schedule or anything set in stone, I just want to have fun and perhaps share some important lessons I learned in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my Two Beans!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="General"></category><category term="mark"></category><category term="hello"></category><category term="blog"></category></entry></feed>
