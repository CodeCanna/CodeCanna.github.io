# Hello, World!

Hello!  Welcome to the first post of my blog.  This feels akin to writing in a diary, except it's meant to be shared.  My name is Mark, and I'm starting this blog to hold everything that my brain can't anymore.  I learn as I get older the more important realestate in my brain becomes.  Here I will write my two cents(beans) about different topics I find interesting or that I think should just be written about.

This is the beginning of my journey into the world of blogging.  What am I looking to get out of it?  I ask myself this question as well, and I haven't quite answered that yet, maybe thats the whole point of this...

Right now there's not set upload schedule or anything set in stone, I just want to have fun and perhaps share some important lessons I learned in my life.

This was my Two Beans!
